# Shen Support Bible


## 1. Introduction

Shen Support is a pick that relies completely on your teammates (soloQ nightmare) - engaging and peeling for your team.  
It is not a pick that can carry or deal any substantial (non-emotional) damage.  
I like to think of it as a less tanky, more damage, roaming, global presence Leona.

Shen, on the surface, is a really simple champion.  
But the more you master him, the more you master the game.  
And the more you master the game, the more you master Shen.  
Shen is a lifestyle.

### Match-ups

#### Support

Playing against:

1. **Enchanter**:
    - Generally the easiest matchup.
    - Very passive, can't deal with your early aggression.
    - **Examples**: Sona, Soraka, Seraphine

2. **Poke**:
    - Managable matchup.
    - Can drop your health bar below 50% in just one combo while you can't even see them on your screen.
    - Wait out their important CDs and go all in on their ADC.
    - Maintain brush control and be the one zoning *them* off.
    - **Examples**: Xerath, Zyra, Lux

3. **Engage**:
    - The hardest matchup.
    - Most engage supports have way longer CC chains and range than you. Wait out their important CDs and go in, otherwise this is just a battle of "whoever engages first, loses".
    - If they engage on your ADC, you counter-engage on theirs and, with them having wasted all their CC, you win the fight.
    - Generally don't look to engage first when they have their CC up.
    - **Examples**: Leona, Pyke, Nautilus


#### ADC

##### Archetypes

Archetype      | Description | Examples
-------------- | ----------- | --------
Auto-Attackers | Their damage comes mostly out of their auto-attacks | Ashe, Tristana, Twitch
All-Ins        | Rely on all-in'ing the enemy. All or nothing | Samira, Nilah, Twitch
Pokers         | Play safe, keep distance and attack from long range | Ezreal, Ashe, Caitlyn
Lane Bullies   | Aggressive early game | Caitlyn, Draven, Lucian, Jinx, Tristana, Vayne
Scalers        | Hypercarries: Weaker, safe early game with insane scaling / late-game | Smolder, Zeri, Senna
Utility        | Strong CC and/or engage | Ashe, Jhin, Senna, Varus, Xayah
Mobile         | High amounts of mobility (blinks, dashes) | Ezreal, Tristana, Vayne, Lucian

##### Grading

The best ADCs to play with Shen Support are those that can match his early game aggression and can easily follow-up on your engages to all-in the enemy.  
On the other hand, the worst ADC to play with (or the best to play against) are the exact opposite - safe, passive, scaling pokers (pussies).  

Grading scores:

- **Playing with**:
    - `(+5)` **All-in**: The best of all. Not usually lane bullies, but you can be behind and still win an all-in with them. Match your all-in aggression.
    - `(+4)` **Lane Bully**: Better than hypercarries, since you rely so much on your early-game. Match well with your aggression.
    - `(+3)` **Hypercarry**: Little weaker early, but better than mobile, since you can snowball them into oblivion
    - `(+2)` **Mobile**: Better than utility, since they can easily follow-up on your engage
    - `(+1)` **Utility**: Better than pokers, because they can follow-up with their CC after your engage or vice versa.
    - `( 0)` **Auto-Attacker**
    - `(-1)` **Poker**: Play rather safe and behind, better than scalers. Peel and survive.
    - `(-2)` **Scaler**: Usually more passive and boring lane, cannot engage with scalers as they do close to 0 damage. Dont match well with your insane lvl 2 aggression. Peel and survive.
- **Playing against**:
    - `(+4)` **Scaler**: Wants to play passive and safe. We ain't letting that slide. Punish them early while you can. Your early game is unmatched.
    - `(+3)` **Auto-Attacker**: You hard-counter any AA-heavy ADCs with one ability, your W. Insane peeling and unmatchable trades. One of, if not the easiest ADC archetype to play against.
    - `(+2)` **All-in**: Not that bad actually. With the amount of peeling you provide (W, E), it is impossible for them all-in, therefore rendering their entire playstyle useless. Usually dont engage when they got their ults up.
    - `(+1)` **Hypercarry**: Rely on snowballing. Good luck doing that with Shen Support in the lane. Impossible task. Punish them early while you can. Your early game is unmatched.
    - `(-1)` **Poker**: Just annoying. Maintain brush control during laning phase, zone them off and look for engages. Better than utility, since it's easier to engage on.
    - `(-2)` **Utility**: Can make it easier shutdown your engages with their CC/Utility. Wait out their CDs then all-in. Better than mobile, since they cannot escape your engages.
    - `(-3)` **Mobile**: Can easily escape your engages and all-ins. Look for cheeky hexflash taunts. Better than lane bully since cannot match your early game, just avoid it.
    - `(-4)` **Lane Bully**: Can match, or even worse - outmatch, your early aggression and push you off your lane, shutting off your early aggression, that you rely at.

- Passive ADC + Engage Support
- Passive ADC + Enchanter Support
- Passive ADC + Poke Support
- Aggressive ADC + Enchanter Support
- Aggressive ADC + Poke Support
- Aggressive ADC + Engage Support

## 2. Playstyle

### 2.1. Roaming

You can roam whenever your ADC *should* not be in immediate danger and ideally you're not missing on a crap-ton of xp. You can identify both those conditions by analyzing your wave state.

That being said, when attempting to roam, you should have a clear goal in mind by analyzing your laners' wave states and both the junglers' positions.

Example: Your wave is pushed into their turret, jungler is topside, mid wave pushing into your turret. Conclusion: ADC safe, mid gankable. GANK MID!

### 2.2. Vision

Never back if you haven't used up all your wards!
Buy a control ward or two on every back!
Contest vision on every objective by placing down control wards.
When roaming, get deep vision into enemy jungle to track the enemy jungler's position. That's very important for ganking or counter-ganking.

### 2.3. Map Awareness

...

### 2.4. Early Game

#### Game Start

Spam ping your team to invade the enemy botside jungle. Shen is ultra strong lvl 1 with his E (taunt).
Look to taunt as many enemies as possible, even if it costs you your flash, just to burn their summoners or even get some kills.
Their flash is worth much more than yours (as a support with hexflash).
This will make the early game much easier for you as a melee support.

If your team is boring and decides no to invade: place a ward, back and swap for sweeper to fight for your lane brush.

#### Laning Phase

##### Lane Brushes

FIGHT FOR YOUR LANE BRUSHES!  

- Sweep any wards placed in YOUR brushes!  
- Buy control wards to protect it!  
- Get early sweeper.

##### Zoning

If not in a position of ideal engage/trade, constantly zone enemies off.  
Punish last hits and do not let their ADC CS at all, even at the cost of your own health.  
Your sheer presence makes them fear the blade.

##### Engaging / Trading

Ideally always engage when you're certain your ADC can follow up (good position, high mana, high health).

Ideally engage/trade when the following conditions apply:

- Keystone off CD
- Support item off CD
- QWE off CD
- Full energy for 6Q
- Important enemy abilities off CD that could fuck you up (lux Q, leone E)
- If vsing engage support, wait for their CDs or them to go in on your ADC to then engage on theirs

At lvl 2 your engage combo is (6Q):

- Ping
- Q
- Wait until 3/4s left on Q cd
- E in
- 3xAA (HoB)
- Emp Q
- walk behind enemy for slow
- 3xAA (emp)

Lvl 3 you can start trading your own health with their ADC's.  
Lvl 3+ trade combo (3/6Q):

- Q
- Wait until 3/4s left on Q cd
- E in
- 3xAA (HoB)
- *ADC decides to follow*:
	- Emp Q
	- Walk behind for slow
	- 3xAA (emp)
	- Walk away
	- W to avoid poke
- *ADC doesn't follow*:
	- Walk away
	- QW

##### Level 6

Level 6 is a huge power-spike for your entire team. You have immense global pressure. That being said, during laning phase, never R away on vision and when your ADC would be in danger (i.e. potential dive), even if you could have made a perfect play. All of that is true only if your ADC is not mentalliy ill. If that's the case, then don't even bother thinking about them.

##### Ganks

With such aggressive playstyle you are just asking to get ganked. You can expect a first potential gank at 2:30 (3 camps) or 3:30 (full clear, most likely). Look out for these timers and have a ward ready.

If you do get ganked, do not run away along your ADC.
Rather walk slightly behind him, so that if enemies do engage on him, you can always E into them, both disengaging and dashing away in the direction of your tower to safety.

##### Disabled ADC

If your ADC is mentally ill and/or running it down, play around your carries. Survive to lvl 6 and visit your lane once in a while to leech off some xp. After lvl 6, constantly roam. Shen is not a level/gold dependent champion, especially with your build being this dirt cheap.

### 2.5. Mid/Late Game

Prioritize peeling your carries!

- W to block incoming AAs
- E to block important abilities
- R for massive (double/stronger w/ Moonstone) shields.
- Locket
- Redemption
- Knight's Vow
- (Mikael's?)

You are a peeling MONSTER!!!

You are also the playmaker.  
Look for opportunities to engage and make a play.  
Only engage if your team can follow! You cannot even 1v1 the enemy support.

### 2.6. Abilities

Ability order: **R > E > Q > W**  
Maxing E for lower CD is the most optimal, as it allows you to taunt more often during a teamfight.

- **Q**: Whenever you get emp Q, if possible, always try to walk behind the enemy in order to proc the slow!
 
- **W**: Never panic-use W after E. Save it either for escape or peel.

- **E**:
	- Dont hesitate to flash to peel or get a better angle to taunt multiple targets in a teamfight, if it ever so slightly increases the chances of winning one
	- If you're in melee range of the enemy, do not E immediately (unless its for peel), but rather Q>AA as much as you can and E if they try to get away and escape.
	- Always E max range, so that if you miss, you can flash after it. Whereas you could not have reacted if you E melee range

- **R**: Good R usage is what makes a good shen. Theres a couple of R "types":
	
	- **Peel (close) R**: Only use close Rs after you've used both W and E and you've got nothing left to peel your carry. Use only before your carry is just about to die! Dont panic-use it too quickly, potentially wasting it. But also dont wait before its too late. It requires great knowledge of the enemies' damage not to waste a peel R. Sprinkle in as many AAs before having to R.
	
	- **1v2 (saving) R**: If your teammate is ABOUT TO enter a 1v2, R immediately as soon as possible (if the fight does look winnable). If its too late and ur mate is already in a 1v2, identify the situation to see if its saveable and winnable. With a 1v2 R you do not want to give the enemy a double, or waste the R to your teammate dying immediately. In most cases, do not R if its 1v3, 1v4 etc. unless you're that confident in your teammates!
	
	- **1v1 (proactive) R**: If enemy is overextended, ult your mate (even if he's not in immediate danger) just to make it a 2v1 and secure a kill!
	
	- **Clutch R**: If your mate is about to die, (ignite, cait R, senna R, ezreal R) immediately R to clutch-save them if there's no enemies nearby and they have no escape options from the immediate danger (flash, dashes, blinks), otherwise look at 1v2 R

	- **TP R**: Use it as a TP to get into teamfights faster.

### 2.7. Combos

- **E + Flash**: Never Flash+E, since the enemy has some time to react with their flash as well. With E+Flash you can also bait out their flash before you flash.
- **6Q**: Explained in detail in the laning phase section

That's it haha.

## 3. Build

### 3.1. Itemization

- **Celestial Opposition**: Timed correctly with your engages, gives massive slow and with your trades, mitigates tons of damage!
- **CDR Boots**: Great value for your whole kit. More taunts, more ults, more Ws, more peel!
- Locket
- Redemption
- **Moonstone**: bigger, double shields (Passive, Locket, R), bigger heals (Redemption, Mikael's)
- Knight's Vow / Mikael's

### 3.2. Runes

#### Primary:

The domination tree is the best primary tree for Shen Support, as it strengthens your already insanely strong early game. You, as shen support, rely on your early game power and aggression, making this tree the best possible choice.

- **Hail of Blades**: HoB is hands-down the best keystone for shen. The early game pressure it provides is insane and other runes cannot even come close. The extra attack speed benefits your trades massively.

- **Cheap Shot**: Cheap shot can proc on all AAs during E and emp Q and outside CC, whereas sudden impact only procs on one AA after E
- **Zombie Ward**: Better than ghost poro + works well with early sweeper

- **Ultimate Hunter**: Shen R has one of the longest CDs in the game. Any amount of CDR on ur R cannot compare to the bonus gold (Treasure Hunter) or movement speed (Relentless Hunter)

#### Secondary:

Inspiration tree

- **Hexflash**: Allows for really aggressive, creative and otherwise impossible engages and insane ganks
- **Cosmic Insight**: Really good for all the active items you're building (Locket, Redemption) and getting your flash & ignite sooner.

#### Stats:

- ATK Speed
- Adaptive Force
- Health Scaling

### 3.3. Summoner Spells

As Shen support, there are only really two viable spells: flash  w/ ignite or exhaust. Mid/late game, exhaust is much better in teamfights and peeling, whereas ignite is nowhere near that useful. As previously mentioned, you really on hard-stomping your lane early game. Making ignite the preferred summoner spell.
